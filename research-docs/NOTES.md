# SUMMARY FROM THE RESEARCH

## TAMPERING TECHNIQUES

### POINTS

- **Partial Earth Faults**: Live is connected to ground instead of neutral, hence the part of current is diverted to ground making return (Neutral) current less than phase current.

- **Double Feeding**: Electric appliances (consumer's tools) are connected after the feeder but before the meter to escape the measurement of their usage.

- **Magnetic inteference**: Strong enough magnets can saturate the measuring coils to a point that they 'blind' them, hence inducing errors in measurements.

- **Physical Bypass**: Most common use of jumpers to skip out the meter by connecting jumper wires from the source to the inlet of the individual premises.

- **Missing neutral connection**: Accidental or intentional disconnection of neutral line induces error in meter's measurements.

- **External factors (high voltage, chemical injection)**: These factors primary cause is disruption of measuring circuit purposely to alter the measurements.

- **Time manipulation (Special Case)**: For meters which alter their measurements for peak hours and normal hours, users tend to change their time to get the lowest billing as possible.
